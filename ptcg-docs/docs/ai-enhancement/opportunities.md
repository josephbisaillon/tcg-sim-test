- **Energy Efficiency**: Analyze energy distribution and efficiency

### Probability Calculation

- **Draw Probabilities**: Calculate the probability of drawing specific cards
- **Prize Card Prediction**: Estimate the likelihood of specific cards being in the prize cards
- **Outcome Simulation**: Simulate possible outcomes of actions with probability estimates

### Deck Tracking

- **Remaining Cards**: Track cards remaining in the deck
- **Opponent Deck Prediction**: Predict the opponent's deck composition based on cards played
- **Card Usage Patterns**: Analyze patterns in card usage for both players

## Decision Making

AI can make decisions or suggest optimal plays:

### Move Generation

- **Legal Move Enumeration**: Generate all legal moves in a given game state
- **Move Ranking**: Rank moves based on their potential effectiveness
- **Sequence Planning**: Plan sequences of moves for future turns

### Strategy Formulation

- **Game Plan Development**: Develop overall game plans based on deck composition
- **Adaptation**: Adjust strategy based on the opponent's actions
- **Win Condition Identification**: Identify and pursue the most likely path to victory

### Risk Assessment

- **Risk/Reward Analysis**: Evaluate the risk and potential reward of different actions
- **Resource Management**: Optimize the use of limited resources (energy, supporters, etc.)
- **Defensive Play**: Identify when to play defensively vs. aggressively

## Player Assistance

AI can assist players in making decisions and understanding the game:

### Suggestion Engine

- **Move Suggestions**: Suggest optimal moves to the player
- **Explanation**: Explain why a suggested move is optimal
- **Alternative Options**: Present alternative moves with their pros and cons

### Explanation System

- **Decision Rationale**: Explain the reasoning behind AI decisions
- **Game State Analysis**: Provide analysis of the current game state
- **Learning Opportunities**: Highlight learning opportunities from game situations

### Deck Building Assistant

- **Card Synergy Analysis**: Analyze card synergies within a deck
- **Meta Analysis**: Provide insights on the current meta and effective strategies
- **Deck Improvement Suggestions**: Suggest improvements to player-built decks

## AI Opponent

AI can serve as an opponent for single-player gameplay:

### Difficulty Levels

- **Beginner**: Simple decision-making suitable for new players
- **Intermediate**: More advanced strategy with occasional suboptimal plays
- **Expert**: Highly optimized play using advanced strategies
- **Champion**: Play at the level of top human players

### Different Play Styles
